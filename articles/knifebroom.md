Today, I'm going to tell you the story of the sentient smoke detectors and being named Knifebroom that I created from normal household items.

It all starts when I'm suddenly shaken from my sleep by my wife, who has informed me that a smoke detector is chirping. I'm still not entire sure what reality means at this point because it's around 5:00 AM, so I attempt to determine what it means to chirp. 

In short order, the second alarm begins to chirp shortly after the first. I assume now that they have attained some form of consciousness and are communicating with each other. I have now perceived that they are electronic devices, so I have now decided that the manufacturer has created some sort of artificial life form that can emote via chirps.

Meanwhile, I fashion a Knifebroom:

It's constructed with novelty duct tape from a White Elephant party last December for work, a butter knife, and our broom.

Knifebroom is very effective at opening the swinging battery compartment door to the smoke detector, but ineffective at removing the actual battery. Knifebroom's performance leaves me conflicted, and in my fugue state I consider executing Knifebroom from treason. I ultimately spare its life.

Our bed is lofted and I can reach one smoke detector. I remove its battery and determine that it is still chirping at me. This either indicates that it's connected to mains or it has a secondary power source, possibly zero-point. I accidentally unscrew it from its ceiling mount and determine that it simply runs on electricity from the ceiling. Thoughts of wrapping scissor handles in some sort of plastic to serve as an insulator while I cut it from its socket enter my mind but are urgently flushed out by my returning sense of reason.

The second smoke detector is out of reach and Knifebroom simply offers its encouragement to rectify the chirping situation. Rua and I decide to scavenge the bowels of our apartment building for a ladder or other debris to climb on. There happens to be a ladder.

    WHAT DO YOU DO? TAKE LADDER

Transporting the ladder through the entire building is a five minute affair and at this point I have finally rejected the non-reality of my dream state and replace the batteries in the smoke detectors with precision. The final smoke detector lets out one last chirp as it drinks the electrons from a new battery, after which we place the ladder back in its original location and deal with what just happened.

The End?
